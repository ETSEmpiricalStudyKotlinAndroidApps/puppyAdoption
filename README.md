# PuppyAdoption

![Workflow result](https://github.com/raudonikis/puppyAdoption/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
A submission to the #AndroidDevChallenge and a playground Android application for learning Jetpack Compose.
The application displays some cute pups with the option to adopt the cutest one.
## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Not the most pleasing UI experience, but got to play with and learn some Compose layouts, composables, and a bit of navigation. First experience is great :)
